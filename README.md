# ApolloSim
ApolloSim is a Master's Thesis project by Gavri Kepets at The Cooper Union.

The focus of ApolloSim is to introduce "calibrated noise" to a LIDAR simulation. To do this, ApolloSim reads data from a LIDAR sensor, determines the various point distributions for different materials, and then is able to replicate the noise from the real world in simulation.
